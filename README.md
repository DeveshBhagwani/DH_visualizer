DH_visualizer


üöÄ Features
Interactive Visualization: See a 3D representation of a robotic arm.
Dynamic Input: (I'm assuming you have input fields) Easily input and modify the four DH parameters (theta, d, a, alpha) for each joint.
Real-time Updates: The visualization updates in real-time as you change the parameters.
Simple & Lightweight: No backend required. Runs entirely in your browser.
(You can add or remove features from this list based on your project's capabilities.)

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
Since this is a client-side project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can run it locally without any complex setup.

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/DeveshBhagwani/DH_visualizer.git
Navigate to the directory:
Bash
cd DH_visualizer
Open the file: Simply open the index_v1.html file in your favorite web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
That's it! You can now start inputting your DH parameters to visualize the robotic arm.
